It's important to read the caption of each post carefully. The caption provides valuable information that will help you navigate the repo and find the specific code snippet you're looking for.

Typically, my captions follow a general format that includes a title and a description of where to find the completed code on GitHub. For instance, if you're looking for the code, you would navigate to the Reels repo, then the folder, and finally the folder.
